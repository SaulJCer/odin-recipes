    <h2>Ingredints</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>6 slices bacon</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced green onions, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to the pot to dry.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, arrange bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain bacon on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble and set aside</li>
        <li>Combine 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese, evaporated milk, 1/2 cup green onions, sour cream, 1/2 of the crumbled bacon, salt, and black pepper in the pot with potatoes. Mash with a potato masher until creamy.</li>
        <li>Spread mixture into the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining Cheddar cheese, green onions, and bacon. Return to the oven and continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
